## 🎯 **Get a Better URL (2 minutes):**

Your current URL is ugly. Let's fix it!

### **Option A: Vercel Free Domain**

Go to your Vercel dashboard:
1. https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "servercraft-landing" project
3. Go to "Settings" → "Domains"
4. You can get: `servercraft-landing.vercel.app` (cleaner!)

### **Option B: Custom Domain** ✅ Recommended

Buy a domain and connect it:

**Cheap Domains:**
- Namecheap: `servercraft.io` ($10/year)
- Porkbun: `servercraft.co` ($8/year)  
- Cloudflare: `servercraft.app` ($10/year)

**Then in Vercel:**
1. Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS records (Vercel shows you how)
4. Done! `servercraft.io` 🎉

## 📝 **Waitlist Form Setup:**

I embedded a Tally.so form. You need to:

1. Go to https://tally.so
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create a form: "Join ServerCraft Waitlist"
4. Fields: Name, Email, "What servers do you run?"
5. Copy your form URL
6. Replace in `app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line ~342
src="https://tally.so/embed/YOUR_FORM_ID?..."
```

**Or keep the placeholder** - it works but goes to a demo form.

## 🚀 **Share It NOW:**

### **Reddit Posts (Copy & Paste):**

**r/admincraft:**
```
Title: Built an AI-powered Minecraft server management console

Hey admins! I've been building a better way to manage Minecraft servers. 

Tired of SSH and clunky panels? I made ServerCraft - it's like Vercel but for Minecraft servers:
- Real-time control panel
- AI-powered automation  
- Timezone-aware scheduling
- Mod management
- Beautiful modern UI

Still in beta, but you can join the waitlist: [your-url]

Looking for feedback from server admins! What features would you want?

**r/minecraft:**
```
Title: Made a control panel for Minecraft server owners

For anyone running a Minecraft server - I built a tool that makes management way easier.

Check it out: [your-url]

It's like having a co-pilot for your server. Still working on it, but curious what the community thinks!
```

### **Twitter/X:**

## 📊 **Track Performance:**

### **Week 1 Goal: 100 sign-ups**

Check your metrics:
- Tally.so responses
- Vercel analytics (free)
- Twitter engagement

**If you get 100+ sign-ups:** ✅ BUILD IT!  
**If you get 50-100:** Talk to sign-ups, iterate  
**If you get <50:** Improve landing page or pivot  

---

## 🎯 **Improve Landing Page:**

### **Add Screenshots (2 hours):**
1. Take beautiful screenshots of your ServerCraft dashboard
2. Add them to landing page
3. Use https://shots.so or https://screely.com for fancy frames

### **Add Testimonials (when you have users):**
```html
"ServerCraft saved me hours every week!" - YouTuber123
```

### **Add Video Demo (optional):**
Record a 2-minute demo on Loom, embed it.

---

## 💰 **Pricing Strategy:**

I set it at **$9/mo Pro** because:
- Competitors charge $10-30/mo
- Round number, easy decision
- Not too cheap (devalues product)
- Not too expensive (scares away indies)

**You can change it!** Edit `app/page.tsx` line ~230

---

## 🔄 **Make Changes:**

```bash
cd "/Users/joshua/servercraft-landing"

# Edit app/page.tsx
# Make changes

git add .
git commit -m "Update pricing/features/etc"
git push

# Auto-deploys to Vercel! ✨
```
