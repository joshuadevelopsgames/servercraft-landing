# 📧 Waitlist Form - Setup Complete!

## ✅ **Fixed! Working Form Now Live**

Your waitlist form now uses **Formspree** (free, no signup needed initially).

---

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### **When Someone Submits:**
1. They fill out: Name, Email, Message
2. Form sends to Formspree
3. **First submission:** Formspree sends YOU an email to verify
4. You click "Confirm" in that email
5. **All future submissions** go directly to your email! ✅

---

## 📧 **What You'll Receive:**

Every waitlist sign-up sends you an email with:
```
Name: John Smith
Email: john@example.com
Message: I run a modded server with 50 players!
```

**No dashboard needed!** Just check your email inbox.
